                <p> Connecting with potential customers online can be a
                difficult process For incoming email, the experience is
                similarly smooth: once you reconnect, new emails from the
                server appear at the top of your inbox. In between, you’ve got
                a more or less complete local copy of all your emails up to
                this point, so you’re never stuck with an empty app. All three
                scenarios (client push fails, client pull/server push fails,
                availability of local data when offline) are well handled.

                Emails, as it turns out, are easy. They’re un-editable, easily
                listable, text-based, and conflict-free, and the notion of
                having local copies is already well established with email
                users. But there are so many more possibilities. How do we
                handle these scenarios, for example, in a collaborative drawing
                app? What if we’re not dealing with immutable items like email,
                but map markers with changing attributes, midi tracks,</p>

                <p> We believe we can fly That problem is solved, in part, by
                richer clients, where more of the application logic runs in the
                browser—like Google Docs, for example. But for a proper
                offline-first experience, you also want to store the data in
                the front end, and you want it to sync to the server’s data
                store. Happily, in-browser databases are maturing, and there
                are an increasing number of solutions for this—like derby.js,
                Lawnchair, Hoodie, Firebase, remotestorage.io, Sencha touch,
                and others—so solving the technical aspects is getting easier.

                But we have bigger, and much weirder, fish to fry: designing
                apps and their interfaces for intermittent connectivity leads
                to an abundance of new scenarios and</p>
