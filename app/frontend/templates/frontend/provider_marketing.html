                Going offline while using Google Docs in a browser other than
                Chrome can be quite frustrating: you can’t edit your document.
                And while reading is still possible, copying parts of it
                isn’t. You can’t do anything with your text or spreadsheet—not
                even copy it to another program to continue working there. And
                yet, this is actually an improvement over past versions, where
                a large overlay would notify you of the offline state and
                prevent you from even seeing your work.

                This is a common occurrence in both native and web apps: data
                you’ve only just accessed suddenly becomes unavailable when
                you lose your connection. If possible, apps should retain
                their last state and make their data available, even if it
                can’t be modified. This requires keeping local data to fall
                back to if the server can’t be reached, so your users are
                never stranded with an empty app.

                <p> We believe we can fly If your app offers collaborative
                editing or some other form of simultaneous use on multiple
                devices, you will likely create conflicting versions of
                objects at some point. We can’t prevent this, but we can
                provide easily usable conflict-resolution UIs for people who
                might not even understand what a sync conflict is.

                Take Evernote, whose business is heavily based on syncing
                notes: conflicts are resolved by simply concatenating both
                versions of the note. On anything longer than a couple of
                lines, this requires an inordinate amount of cognitive effort
                and subsequent editing.

                Draft, on the other hand, has managed to make conflict
